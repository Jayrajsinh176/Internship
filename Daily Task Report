  When a user submits a form, the data they filled in is sent to the system.

  such as a success message or an error.

### Task 4: GitHub Update
- What is MVC : MVC (Model–View–Controller) is a design pattern used to build complete  web  applications.
                Model -> stores and manages data (database logic)
                View → shows the user interface (HTML pages)
                Controller → handles user requests and connects Model & View
                MVC is mainly used when **frontend and backend are together.

- What is API : API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for applications to communicate using data.
                It does not return web pages
                It returns data (mostly JSON)
                Used when frontend and backend are separate
                APIs are mostly used with **React, mobile apps, or other systems.
