DAY 2 TASK

Task 1: Understand Application Flow

- What happens when a user submits a form ?

  When a user submits a form, the data they filled in is sent to the system. 
  The form checks if all required information is entered correctly. 
  Then the data is processed, and the user gets a response, 
  such as a success message or an error.

Task 4:

What is MVC?
    MVC (Model–View–Controller) is a design pattern used to build complete web applications.
    Model -> stores and manages data (database logic)
    View → shows the user interface (HTML pages)
    Controller → handles user requests and connects Model & View
    MVC is mainly used when **frontend and backend are together.

What is API?
    API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for applications to communicate using data.
    It does not return web pages
    It returns data (mostly JSON)
    Used when frontend and backend are separate
    APIs are mostly used with **React, mobile apps, or other systems.
